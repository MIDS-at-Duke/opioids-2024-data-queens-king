## Estimating the Effectiveness of Opioid Control Policies

This repository contains the analysis and code used for the project "Estimating the Effectiveness of Opioid Control Policies", conducted as part of IDS720: Practical Data Science. The study evaluates the impact of opioid policies in Florida and Washington on opioid prescription rates and overdose mortality using pre-post and difference-in-difference (DiD) methods.

## Project Overview

The opioid crisis is a significant public health challenge in the U.S., with over 80,000 overdose deaths annually. This project investigates the effectiveness of state-level policy interventions in reducing opioid availability and related harms.

## Key Findings
- Florida: Significant and sustained reductions in opioid shipments and overdose deaths post-policy implementation.
- Washington: Initial reductions in both metrics, but effects were not sustained over time. Washington's outcomes highlight challenges in sustaining policy effectiveness over time, possibly due to systemic factors like illicit opioid markets.

## Methodology
- **Pre-Post Analysis:** Assesses trends within states before and after policy implementation.
- **Difference-in-Difference (DiD) Analysis:** Compares treated states (Florida, Washington) with control states to isolate policy effects.

## Results and Conclusion
Florida’s multi-faceted policy measures proved more effective in achieving sustained reductions in opioid harms compared to Washington's efforts. Washington's experience underscores the importance of addressing systemic factors like illicit opioid markets and adopting complementary interventions for sustained impact. These findings provide valuable insights for policymakers addressing the opioid epidemic.

Future research could explore complementary interventions and systemic factors to further enhance policy effectiveness in addressing the opioid crisis.
